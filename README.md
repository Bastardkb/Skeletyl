### Important note on V4/V3

The revision 4 of the skeletyl introduces drastic changes with the bottom plate. It reuses the positioning of the screws of the Charybdis Nano, so that the Organic tent can be re-used. It also uses new voronoi-style plates.

When choosing a model to print, be mindful of the version you choose. The files in the `V3` folder are **not** compatible with the V4 case and alien tents. Unless you want to use one of the `V3` mods, we recommend using the latest version `V4`.

### Print files and instructions

The STL files are included in this Github repository, in the `files` folder.

Please find detailed instructions on how to print the case on the online instructions linked below.
