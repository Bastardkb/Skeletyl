# Sourcing the components

## Electronic components

You will need to order the parts from a shop, and order some PCBs directly from the manufacturer.

## Print the case

The STL, STEP and Fusion files are included in this Github.
Feel free to modify them at length. The files are on a non-commercial license, so this is for personal projects only - please do not use those to sell them.

Please find detailed instructions on how to print the case here:
https://docs.bastardkb.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020031180-Print-settings-for-Dactyls

There is also a version that uses a blackpill with its shield PCB, in the `V3/blackpill` folder. The position of the audio jack and usb-c holes are slightly different.

## Print the tents

Optionally, you can print 30 degree tents. Those are removable and attached with screws, and also come with an optional bottom plate.

The tents come in 2 versions: normal, and organic. The organic one provides a sleeker skeleton-style look with a side holder for the shield pcb, but is longer and harder to print.
