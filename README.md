# Sourcing the components

## Electronic components

You will need to order the parts from a shop, and order some PCBs directly from the manufacturer.

Parts list:

## 3d Parts compatibility

The revision 4 of the skeletyl introduces drastic changes with the bottom plate. It reuses the positioning of the screws of the Charybdis Nano, so that the Organic tent can be re-used. It also uses new voronoi-style plates.

When choosing a model to print, be mindful of the version you choose. The files in the `V3` folder are **not** compatible with the V4 case. Since the V4 was made for homogeneity purposes only and doesn't bring any major improvements, if you want to use any of the `V3` mods that are not translated yet, go for the `V3`.

## Print the case

The STL, STEP and Fusion files are included in this Github.
Feel free to modify them at length. The files are on a non-commercial license, so this is for personal projects only - please do not use those to sell them.

Please find detailed instructions on how to print the case here:
https://docs.bastardkb.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020031180-Print-settings-for-Dactyls

There is also a version that uses a blackpill with its shield PCB, in the `V3/blackpill` folder. The position of the audio jack and usb-c holes are slightly different.

## Print the tents

Optionally, you can print 30 degree tents. Those are removable and attached with screws, and also come with an optional bottom plate.

The tents come in 2 versions: normal, and organic. The organic one provides a sleeker skeleton-style look with a side holder for the shield pcb, but is longer and harder to print.

**Important information**: if you are using the skeletyl V4, there are no normal tents. Instead, the alien tents of the Charybdis Nano should be used - either 15 or 30 degrees.

# Mods
## Chair mount plate  
### V4 version plate
Requires a 1/4-20 UNC heat insert. Standard 1/4 inch camera mount thread.
There is a version with bumpon stands so the keyboard can sit flat on a surface when not mounted.

### V3 version plate  
Alternate bottom plate for mounting to a chair or desk using standard camera mounting equipment. Fits 1/4 inch mounting bolt (1/4-20 UNC).
