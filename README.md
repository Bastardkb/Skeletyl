# Sourcing the components

## Electronic components

You will need to order the parts from a shop, and order some PCBs directly from the manufacturer.

The Elite-C Adapters are open-source. At this moment, the flexible PCBs are not. Instead, you can use Amoebas.

Parts list:

If you don't want to source the Elite-C adapter PCB, you can use the [printable shield adapter from Geoff](https://github.com/geoffder/dometyl-keyboard/blob/main/things/holders/bastardkb/printable_shield.stl).

If you don't want to source the flexible PCBs, you can also use either amoebas or handwire.

If you want RGB, you will also need:

| Part name          | Amount | Link       |
| ------------------ | ------ | ---------- |
| SK6812 Mini-E LEDs | 36     | Aliexpress |
