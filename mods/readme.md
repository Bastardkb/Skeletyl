# Magsafe

Is's possible to add tenting to your keyboard by using magsafe magnets and tripods.

The `magsafe` folder contains:
- STL files meant to be 3d printed and used with magnet stickers
- A DXF file meant to be laser cut

If you are ordering laser-cut plates, make sure to use a magnetic material such as steel.
